# NewsApp
This is a simple News Application that displays the latest news headlines from various sources using the NewsAPI.

## About this App
The app is built using the following tech stack:

Kotlin: programming language used for the Android app<br>
Room Persistence Library: database used for storing saved news articles<br>
Retrofit: used for making API requests to the NewsAPI<br>
Coroutines: used for asynchronous programming and managing background tasks<br>
WebView: used for displaying the news article detail page<br>
Navigation Component: used for managing the navigation between different screens of the app<br>
MVVM architecture: used to separate the app into three distinct layers - Model, View, and ViewModel<br>
ViewModel and LiveData: used to manage the UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware way<br>
<br>
In summary, the app allows users to browse and save news articles from different sources, even when they are offline. The app uses the MVVM architecture with ViewModel and LiveData to manage the app data and UI updates. The app also uses several popular Android libraries such as Retrofit, Room, and Coroutines to make API requests, store data, and manage asynchronous tasks.
